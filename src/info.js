        <p>Good air quality is fundamental to our well-being. On average, a person inhales about 15.000 litres of air every day, and the presence of contaminants in this air can adversely affect peopleâ€™s health. People with pre-existing respiratory and heart conditions, diabetes, the young, and older people are particularly vulnerable.</p>
        <p>International studies have shown poor air quality can also adversely affect the natural environment. Ecological damage may occur when air pollutants come into direct contact with vegetation or when animals inhale them. Pollutants can also settle out of the air onto land and water bodies. From the soil, they can wash into waterways, or be taken up by plants and animals. Poor air quality can also affect our climate: some pollutants have a warming effect while others contribute to cooling (European Environment Agency, 2013).</p>
